As an avid fan of the epic series _A Song of Ice and Fire_, I have a hard time keeping up with all of the characters who lose their heads. As such, I would like to have an application that can helps me track which characters from the series are alive or dead.

Please provide an application that satisfies the following criteria:

Here is a sample markdown that satisfies the given criteria:

- [ ] Uses [An API of Ice & Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/) as a data source.
- [ ] Is built using your tech stack of choice.
- [ ] The Houses resource from the [API](https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses) is paginated by default to 10 results, for these 10 houses please display a list of all of their _Sworn Members_ grouped by house.
- [ ] For each _Sworn Member_ display their full name and whether they are alive or dead.
- [ ] If a character is dead, please display the information provided by the API about their death.
- [ ] If a house has no _Sworn Members_, please display the message _This house has no sworn members_.

You are welcome to use tools like ChatGPT if that is part of your daily workflow but please be prepared to defend your choice to use those tools and provide alternate methods if requested on review.

Submissions will be accepted in the form of GitHub link, CodeSandbox link or zip file. Please provide instructions for how to run the application.
